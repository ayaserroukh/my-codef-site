## A Melting pot of Lifestyles, Races and Cultures.

* Morocco is where Europe meets Africa and the Middle East. Here you will find a rich and diverse history that includes different dynasties, the Romans, the Berbers, Jews, Spaniards, Africans and Arabs.
 * Moroccans mainly speak a specific form of colloquial Arabic known as darija, which is a mix of Arabic with considerable French, Spanish and Berber influences. Although French is commonly prevalent in the business world.
  * Across Moroccan cities it is common to see people wearing a variety of different clothing styles, from Western garments to the traditional djellaba, a hooded robe that is worn over other clothing in several North African countries.
   * Away from the urban centres, traditional Berber clothing is more common, with women generally wearing coloured garments and ornate jewellery. Berber designs also permeate much of Moroccoâ€™s handicrafts, such as leather goods, carpets, blankets and silver jewellery.
